# Bongoat Worker

This is a personal project developed to test out Dev Containers in VS Code as well as Cloudflare Workers.

This project also interfaces with Discord and Minecraft in order to create a Discord interaction that allows users to whitelist themselves to a Minecraft server via a discord interaction event.

Instead of handling this task with a long running bot, the interactions can all be done serverless via the Discord REST API.
